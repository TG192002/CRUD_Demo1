# CRUD_Demo1
This project is a Windows Forms Application built using Visual Studio 2022 (.NET Framework) and SQL Server 2016. It implements a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage data records.
**Features**
Insert: Add new records into the database.
Read: Display existing records in the database on the user interface.
Update: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
The user interface is simple and user-friendly, containing textboxes for entering data fields (ID, Name, Age) and buttons to perform the CRUD operations. A display panel (likely a DataGridView or ListBox) is included to show the data retrieved from the database.

**Technologies Used**
C#: Programming language for Windows Forms application development.
SQL Server 2016: Database for storing, retrieving, and managing records.
Visual Studio 2022: IDE for development.
.NET Framework: Runtime environment for the application.
